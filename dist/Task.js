/* Understanding TypeScript:

TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that adds static typing to the language.
This means you can define types for variables, function parameters, and return values,
which helps catch errors during development rather than at runtime. Here are some key points:

* Static Typing: Unlike JavaScript, TypeScript allows you to specify types, which can prevent type-related errors.

* Enhanced IDE Support: With TypeScript, you get better code completion, navigation, and refactoring in your IDE.

* Modern JavaScript Features: TypeScript supports the latest JavaScript features and can compile down to older versions for compatibility.

* Improved Code Quality: By catching errors early and providing a more structured codebase, TypeScript can lead to more maintainable and robust applications.

Setting Up TypeScript:

To set up TypeScript, follow these steps:

* Install Node.js: Ensure you have Node.js installed on your machine. You can download it from nodejs.org.
* Install TypeScript: Open your terminal and run the following command to install TypeScript globally:

npm install -g typescript

Initialize a TypeScript Project: Navigate to your project directory and run:

tsc --init

This command creates a tsconfig.json file, which is used to configure the TypeScript compiler options.
Create a TypeScript File: Create a new file with a .ts extension, for example, index.ts. You can write your TypeScript code in this file.
Compile TypeScript to JavaScript: To compile your TypeScript code to JavaScript, run:

tsc

This command will compile all .ts files in your project according to the settings in tsconfig.json.
Run the JavaScript File: You can now run the compiled JavaScript file using Node.js:
node index.js

For more detailed instructions, you can refer to the guides mentioned:
